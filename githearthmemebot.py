Why is it that almost every time I play Alleycat, the Alleycat gets killed first? When I played another hunter, why did they always trade in their Alleycat before Tabbycat? Or let Tabbycat be the only one to feel the glorious power of Crackling Razormaw?It seemed really strange to me that everyone would be so negligent of Alleycat, so I started digging for answers. I went on the subreddit, I watched streamers, I even started adding people I played, and everyone told me the same thing: Tabbycat is Cute Cat, and Alleycat is Ugly Cat.\n\n\"Cute Cat.\" What. The. Fuck.\n\nSeriously, what the fuck? First, that name doesn't even make sense. I'm more of a snek guy than a cat guy, but I still know a cute cat when I see one, and they're both cute. Seriously, I can acknowledge that Tabbycat is cute. Those beautiful green eyes say, \"hey, wanna hang out?\" He has an adorable stance too, very triumphant. He looks a little too big for his britches, and it is cute! I get that!\n\nBut Alleycat is JUST AS CUTE, PEOPLE. His eyes betray a little timidness. Maybe he's nervous because he likes you so much, but is he not still walking towards you? Coming to play, even though there's some sewer gunk in front of him? He's looking right up at you and he looks more humble, more appreciative. Also, his tooth jewelry is a little more tasteful IMO. The only problem I see is a little underbite, but maybe he's just chewing something! A cat has to eat!\n\nI honestly hate to bring this up, but look at the background of Alleycat's art, too. Tabbycat is there, and he looks like a total asshole! Look, he's probably just waking up from a nap or something so I don't want to make any huge assumptions, but come on. Are you really going to tell me with that face that Tabbycat has a \"cute cat\" personality?\n\nI know this seems dumb, but as someone who suffers from acne, who is a little overweight, and who doesn't have the most symmetrical face, I feel the sting of \"Ugly Cat.\" Yeah, I'm Ugly Cat, and it feels like I get killed first too, even though I have the exact same value as the Cute Cat. And everytime Ugly Cat gets shafted in the game, I have to just take it like its my fault. Well, it's not my fault.\n\nIT'S NOT MY FUCKING FAULT I'M AN UGLY PIECE OF SHIT. IF A GIRL WOULD GIVE ME A FUCKING CHANCE I THINK PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THEY DON'T BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO BUSY WITH CUTE CAT CHADS.\n\nFuck you for printing this card Blizzard, it makes your playerbase feel specifically targeted.

         ("([Ss][Uu][Bb][Rr][Ee][Dd][Dd][Ii][Tt]|[Rr]\/[Hh]earth)","Those of you that play this game and complain about it consistently are either incredibly short-tempered then make a quick switch or not willing to fight for change.\n\nDo you honestly think that Blizzard cares what you have to say? \"The packs are too expensive,\" \"there's too much RNG,\" \"It costs too much dust to create cards,\" \"Why don't we have daily login rewards?,\" and my all-time favorite \"This game is too expensive,\" are just a few examples of discussion that is being placed on this subreddit consistently. Hasn't it always been this way and only really gotten worse?\n\nI my be ignorant but has Blizzard really taken any steps to address these issues resulting into actual change for the game and YOUR overall positive experiences? I don't believe so. If I'm correct Blizzard took in around 24M a month last year? Why would they change anything when you keep giving them more money?\n\nI get it. I REALLY do. Last year I was part of the issue. I think I spent around $600 myself (as a new player) on packs and adventures just to get caught up with the rest of you. It was an addiction that grew over a short amount of time. I didn't really begin to get extremely frustrated until I started getting pretty good at the game. The immensely excessive RNG doesn't really bother you until it starts costing you that rank 5, does it?\n\nLet me offer some advice to those of you who are in the same place I was a couple of months ago. Just stop playing...but don't totally let go. After I uninstalled Hearthstone I took it too far (for me)- I unsubscribed from Kibler, Trump, and Kripp on Youtube as well as just pushed away anything that even remotely was connected to the game. I have since found a good balance. I enjoy watching those youtubers and watch daily. The game may be full of BS sometimes but it's fun to watch the RNG happen to others, still. By doing this I am not directly benefiting Blizzard financially near what I used to be, if at all.\n\nIf you seem to hate the game more than you enjoy it (RNjoyment), just stop playing and watch from the sidelines; otherwise you can't really complain without being hypocritical."),
         ("[Rr][Ii][Gg][Gg][Ee][Dd]","Played the game since beta, about four years now, every..single..day. Here's some observations. If you have ever got the feeling the matches and matchmaking was rigged, you are correct. Although nothing can be 100% proven without viewing the actual programmed code for the game, the fact remains that collectively many humans experience, intuition, and millions of play time hours is just as powerful as seeing code. And where there is smoke, there is fire. It's been a rigorous issue for many years, and staunchly defended by Blizzard and concealed in their forums. A genuine third party confirmation has never even been offered to put the question to bed. The game is free to play..But it is rigged, preprogrammed probably to force a 50/50 win rate.. so, you can only really gain up ladder on player misplays, which can be hard to setup. The card drawing is rigged in favor of the hero that directly counters the others deck. When you win a match, the next match your more likely to lose. The heroes all each have at least three counter heroes. 9 total heros, each has three. When you are matched with your heroes counter, your card draw is negatively affected, and the opponents is positively affected. Play a few hundred games and it becomes clear as day. The more games you attempt in a short period of time, it will increase your chances of matching your deck to a counter deck and likely cause you to lose more often. When you make a deck card change, your first match you will likely lose, being outmatched. Also the more games in a row you win, your chances of seeing a counter to your deck increase as you gain on ladder. Your cards are often exacting matched with opponents in the matchmaking. Also counters to your cards. Which often will be top-carded if your hero has to play its counter hero. Even seemingly random cards ..are not at all, the game will create the corresponding outcome for the board state., For example the mech shredder with deathrattle will put out the perfect counter minion often if your hero is the favoured over the opponents. How man times does mech shredder have to put out a doomsayer to destroy your board. The less value cards in your deck, the faster your game plays. Higher values such as 4+ mana cost, will match you to players with higher cards and healing etc. lengthening the match.. One card over 4 mana in your deck could cause you to be matched to a priest that comes back at turn 5 and beats you with heals. Legendaries don't help. They just don't. They offer a chance at winning, but if you fail to use it at the right time, you lose. You will just be overmatched for whichever or how many ever legendaries you stack in your deck with a counter opponent found in matchmaking. Stack 6+ legendaries in your deck and watch as you get matched to a deck that counters every one of your legendaries perfectly.. The matches are predecided to favor one player over the other. This may even include how often you have purchased. You may be the best player, but stuck at rank 20-15 for a purchase-to-time ratio algorithm. There may even exist a seperate matchmaking pool for this purpose. Blizzard employees search out forums and posts that discuss how rigged the game is. Then blast many many \"anti-rigged\" posts from various user IDs. Note all the comments will say confirmation bias, tinfoil hat, and cast insults mainly. You can see the shotgun blast of posts on THE same day just below. Its pretty wild that companies do this to stay afloat. Blizzard eSport tournaments \"cherry pick\" the players that are selected to play ..based on their \"work\" they contribute to Hearthstone. This means you will be vetted for your postings on forums, YouTube streams, etc. Any potentially percieved negative opinions of the game such as my post here, will prevent you from admission to their rigged tournaments. Obviously, they dont want the secret out, and dont want popular tournament winning players catching on and publicizing it later either. The message is this.. \"Either act right..or you lose and wont be invited to tournaments no matter what you achieve on ladder.\""),
         ("([Mm][Uu][Rr][Ll][Oo][Cc])|([Hh][Yy][Dd][Rr][Oo][Ll])","As one of the only two murlocs who have learned to speak the human language, along with Sir Finley, Hydrologist cements her rank and prestige amongst murlocs, and amongst ALL creatures in her world, in or out of Un'goro. She is a smart, independent hydrologist who don’t need no murloc warleader. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, our lovely Hydrologist makes about $38 per hour and $80,000 per year. If you see her on Tinder make sure you have a solid life foundation, because you probably won’t be able to keep up with her. Obviously having gone to one of the most prestigious universities in her world, Hydrologist is used to class and civility. As you can hear in her death quote 'Excuse me..', she expresses that she is only fighting to protect her discoveries! She does not want to fight, but sometimes these things must be done. As one of her best friends always says, 'Justice demands retribution!' Hydrologist is no stranger to success, as she has discovered some of the world's best kept secrets. She has found the ability to make even the most menacing of foes kneel in repentance and forfeit of their evil ways. She has found a way to make her friends in battle rise from the dead, to swing the sword one more time in their shining moment of redemption. She has the charisma to rally even the least of her friends to lay down their life in the most noble sacrifice, to die for one’s friends. She is truly a saint amongst all creatures and, oh by the way, a very good hydrologist to boot! She is really passionate about researching ways to minimize the negative impacts of erosion, sedimentation, or pollution on the environment in Un’goro, and it shows. She knows no equal in her field. Too be so accomplished is truly amazing, but to be a total babe at the same time? Some creatures really do have everything, don't they? Our Hydrologist is a lovey murloc with long locks of red hair, and luscious lips. She is cute and she knows it, that is why she wears a flower on her hat. And you know what they say about females with red hair don't you? She definitely lets loose during the night time, but stays civil and classy during the day. As you can hear in her fight quote 'Mrrgglll mrgglll mrrgll.. heh heh', she sometimes loses herself in a moment of passion, but quickly realizes she what she is doing and decides to pull back. She is passionate in so many ways, but knows when and where to let totally lose. With so many suitors have failed in their attempts to woo her (most notably Sir Finley, Finja, and Uther) it is clear that Hydrologist just doesn’t have time for love. She is married to her work. So the next time you play Hydrologist onto your board, or put her in your deck, or discover her with your broken Dragonid OPerative, respect the grace you have the honor to behold. And thank the gods that you are allowed to put two copies of her in your deck, for she is truly legendary. In fact she was slated as a legendary minion that could only be summoned if you played 3 Tirions, but she asked to be made a common. Why you ask? She said it's because she loves the kids. What a lady!"),

I feel that a vast majority of my Ranked games are decided by Patches the Pirate. You will hear plenty of people say that if it doesn't deal 1 damage it is useless however with so many options like SMOrc, Face, Attack the enemy hero and Charge it makes far too easy to avoid death and at that point, most times only a taunt can really stop it. I like charge, I think it it is an awesome mechanic. I'm okay with snowball cards like Patches the Pirate as well. I'm not sure if some of the aggro options are just too versatile for the card to remain 1/1 at 1 cost and I get that it has a very specific condition to trigger but in the early game I feel you have to keep any removal cards in constructed due to just how quickly things can get out of hand. I'm no professional, and this card is certainly not completely broken but in ranked it can be far too difficult to deal with and whoever draws it first is going to have an unbelievable advantage."),

Like if Pirate Warrior bots have 5 dudes on the board and mine is empty, Pirate Warrior bots spend 30-40 seconds wacking em in the face because Pirate Warrior bots \"think\" between each minion going face. *Pirate Warrior bots also randomly look at cards in their hand, even if Pirate Warrior bots have only 1 card in hand in it's been there for ages. *Incredibly dumb plays like playing Heroic Strike when hero is frozen (this could happen depending on rank of course) *Also, Pirate Warrior bots never concede even though Pirate Warrior bots're out of cards and f2p player just played Reno/Amara. *My personal emote-trigger test (don't do this at home): BM as much as humanly possible, try to rope a few turns. f2p player try to trigger at least an emote from your opponent, it's strengthens your assuption about your opponent being a bot.

What type of poultry tax? Is it some kind of subtle political message? Why does he say this? I can't continue playing Discolock without knowing. It's absolutely ridiculous that Blizzard should have a card say something totally weird without any explanation.

I don’t have a motivation to continue to play it, however. It’s extremely fun, but only using basic cards and the few cards you get from free packs is not fun. If you want to have any chance of winning at all, you have to have a meta deck. Basic cards just don’t cut it.\n\nYou get way too little gold from winning games and doing quests, and the cards in the store are extremely expensive. $3.4 for two packs or $22.4 for fifteen? Considering how you mostly get Common cards, card packs are really not worth their value.\n\nBlizzard should either increase the chance of getting Legendary cards from packs, reward you more gold for completing quests and winning games (a “first win of the day” reward would be neat too), or make packs cheaper in the store. 10 gold for every third game won is nothing."),

Every single one of my packs has been a 40 dust pack, and I've never gotten a golden card in my lifetime. Blizzard's been telling me that the pity timer is 40 packs and that I'll definitely get one every 40 packs, but I'm living proof that this isn't true. I've never even gotten a single legendary. My collection is full of basic, common and rare cards. I didn't manage to get C'Thun because when I opened my WOTOG pack, it told me that I was the 666th person to collect the free C'Thun, so I was denied the reward. I could never buy adventures because whenever I hit the 'Confirm Purchase' button, the game would take my gold and crash, causing my gold to be lost forever.

But today, when I opened a pack, I managed, at last, to get TWO rares in my pack. Not one, but two. The old gods have shined upon me today and have bestowed me with the first non-40 dust pack that I have ever opened. I have never felt more joy in my life than when I saw that I packed not one, but two alarm-o-bots from the same pack. I could not be happier. I just want to thank Blizzard.

Something I want to get off of my chest is how unfair I think Drakonid Operative is, and how it compares to another, better designed Discover card. Let's compare Drakonid Operative to Jeweled Scarab, which in my opinion is still the best designed discover card to date. When you play Scarab, not only is it a 2 mana 1/1, which in this meta is awful. But on the rare occasion you may discover great like Brann which can swing the game, or Mind Control Tech which is only good in certain situations. But other options include: Silverback Patriarch, Magma Rager, Dalaran Mage etc. So while on rare occasions you may get something good, there are a lot of terrible 3 cost cards that Scarab can discover. Now, Drakonid Operative. Operative unlike Scarab has great stats for its cost. You get intel on your opponents deck. 'Oh, he's running Mind Control Tech? Good to know, now I can play around that'. And you will always discover a good/great card. Because obviously your opponent is going to have a deck full of cards they deem solid enough to win them matches. Unless you're a brand new player or you're playing some gimmick deck, all your cards are going to be high tier cards. The other glaring issue is that you can use multiple Operatives in a single match to gain even more knowledge on what you're up against. And what your opponent doesn't have in their hand yet. If discovered with Historian and multiple Operatives are used with Brann, Priest could easily see 1/3rd of your entire deck. Now I know come the first 2017 expansion Dragon Priest is going to take a massive hit anyway. Losing Technician, Guardian, Corrupter etc. So unless Blizzard introduces card good enough to replace them, Dragon Priest will see far less play. But at the moment, unlike Patches or Buccaneer, the card I hate playing against the most is Drakonid Operative. tl;dr.
